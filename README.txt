==============================================================================================

		1. 	Getting Started (Registration and Log-in)
  
==============================================================================================

	Upon landing on the home page (index) of Learning paths, if this is your first time,
	you should be sure to look to the top nav bar for the 'Register' link. Click Register
	and you will come to a form asking for the following details:
	1. First name
	2. Last name
	3. Email
	4. Password
	5. Password again (to ensure it is correct)

	Once you enter this information and click the Register button below, you will either
	be brought to a screen and either
		- recieve a 'Registration Success' message
		- recieve a 'You have already registered this email' message
		- be returned to the form if there are any errors you need to correct 
		  (they will be explicitly stated on the form).

	Once you successfully register, you will be brought to the login screen with a 1-time
	message at the top stating 'Registration Complete! Please login with your credentials'

	Here you re-enter the email and password you previously registered with. If there is 
	any error, you will be shown a screen with an alert that there was an incorrect 
	username or password.
	If there were no errors, you will be brought to your user profile

==============================================================================================

		2: 	User Profile
  
==============================================================================================

	Your user profile will store some information about you as a learner such as your name,
	a photo of your choosing (maximum size: 675KBs) and an 'about-me' section for you 
	to fill out.

	Upon your first successful log in, you will be brought directly to your user profile.
	There will be a  section to change your profile picture to a jpeg (limited size of 
	675kbs) and a textarea for you to fill out an about-me section (first time only)

	Once you submit your about me, you will see it appear on your profile page for all of
	eternity, so you better never change


==============================================================================================

		3: 	Learning Paths
  
==============================================================================================

	When you click the Learning paths link in the nav bar, you will be brought to a page
	which will display your learning paths. In the nav bar, another link will also appear
	that will bring you to the "Create Learning Paths" section of the website. 
	
	Each learning path will provide the ability to show your support with the 'like'
	button, clone the learning path, share the learning path and edit learning paths.

	***  Deletion and editing are only available to the user who created them.  ***


==============================================================================================

		4:	 Creating, Deleting and Editing Learning Paths
  
==============================================================================================

	When you go to the 'Create a Learning Path' link, you will be provided a form which 
	has the following headlines:
		- Learning Path Name
		- Path Description
		- Resources

	The learning path name is the name that you want to provide for the learning path.
	The path description is a description you can give to the learning path so that 
	users will know if it is a path that they might enjoy
	The resources are a list of resources that the learning path will use.
	When you submit, the learning path will be uploaded, and you will see it on the 
	learning paths page.

	If you choose to delete a learning path you have created, select 'delete' on the path.
	You will be redirected to a page where you can enter your password. If you enter your
	password, the path will be successfully removed, and if you enter the wrong password,
	you will see an error and given the chance to try again

	If you choose to edit a learning path you have created, select 'Edit' on the path 
	at the Learning Paths page, you will be brought to the edit page. The edit page 
	will be identical to the create path page, however it will have the preexisting
	information about the path you are editing.
